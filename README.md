# Countries Hangman
'Countries Hangman' is a terminal based Python game in which players have to guess letters or words to find out the name of a country before they are out of lives and the man is hanged.

## User Experience

### User's goals
- To easily interact with the game
- To play a fun and entertaining game of Hangman

- To be clearly informed of what any errors are from any invalid inputs
- To view my score after each game
- To save my high scores to a high scores leaderboard
- To have the option to play the game again or quit
## Design
### Flowchart
I made the following flowchart to show the logic of the game from the start to the end, making sure to include any points where validity checks would be needed.

### Colours
I used colorama to input the following colours:
- Any input error messages from the user are in red as red is a colour often associated with warnings.
- The text is green when the user guesses a letter or word correctly as green is often associated with doing something correctly.
- The text is yellow when the user guesses a letter or word incorrectly or when they are out of lives as I wanted to use a bright colour to stand out, and as I had used red already, I chose yellow as a suitable colour here.
- The initial welcome message is light yellow and bold to make it stand out as the welcoming title of the game.
- The hangman logo is light magenta, again to add a bit of colour to the welcome screen and because this colour is close to red so represents the danger.
